          <h1>Dear Paul Jr,</h1>
          <p>you should know this about your dad…</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section" id="section1">
          <div class="slide" id="slide1" data-anchor="slide1">
              <p>...he’s a really smart guy and will be a great Dad, but one time he & some friends burned down a bus.  Don’t do that.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide2" data-anchor="slide2">
            <p>...your Dad is a gentleman of integrity. He's always willing to lend a hand, work hard and get his hands dirty. His only fault is being a Raiders fan, but some would argue that's a feature, not a bug</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide3" data-anchor="slide3">
            <p>… he’s a great person and leader. We’re all lucky to know him!</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide4" data-anchor="slide4">
            <p>… someday you’ll be so mad at your dad for some nonsense or another. Just remember, you got a Dad who makes the world better in all sorts of small ways. That’s better than winning the lottery. That is winning the lottery.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide5" data-anchor="slide5">
            <p>… in a word, he’s rad! Also: ask to see a photo of him when he had dreadlocks.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide6" data-anchor="slide6">
            <p>… Junior, I just want to second the piece about the photo with the dreadlocks - this could seriously be an ace in the hole for you.  Although just remember that since you are a spawn of Paul you will likely have a picture like this of your own one day.  And you will also likely be a kind, funny and intelligent guy.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide7" data-anchor="slide7">
            <p>….Loves music and obscure bands - trust him when he says a tune in good. He’s also just a top bloke - works hard, takes care of the people around him and has fun.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide8" data-anchor="slide8">
            <p>...He’s a great dad who’s super proud of you and your brother. He’ll cheer you on at your weekly basketball games, he’ll brag about you to his colleagues, and one day he might event take you to a Phish show.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide9" data-anchor="slide9">
            <p>… Is such a genuinely good person that people like, trust and turn too.  He is committed to making the world a better place for you, your brother and everyone else!</p>
          </div>

          <div class="slide" id="slide10" data-anchor="slide10">
            <p>… I agree with the comment above. Your dad is rad! He loves lists, a good meme, tacos, the lakers, the grateful dead and volkswagens. He is an expert friend and will always have your back. You’re a lucky kid!</p>
